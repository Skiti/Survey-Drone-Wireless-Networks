This white paper, "A Survey of Drone Networks, Drone Swarms and Air Pollution Monitoring Systems", was an assignment for my Wireless Networks course, Master's Degree in Computer Science, University of Padova. The State-of-the-Art analysis aims to clarify the current challenges in Drone Networks and Air Pollution Monitoring, in an attempt to provide possible solutions and/or ideas when using sensor-equipped drones.
