This white paper was an assignment for the Wireless Networks exam (2018), Master's Degree in Computer Science, University of Padova.

*Abstract:
Drone-related technology, specifically networks and swarms, has been a thriving research area for many years. UAVs can accomplish a wide array of tasks at an affordable price, featuring uniques strengths compared to other technologies. Drones are commonly used for military, public and private purposes. They still suffer from particular drawbacks and limitations, not completely overcome yet. Many protocols and algorithms were formulated, although massively dependent upon the actual scenario and use cases. The research topic surveyed in this paper will be environmental monitoring, specifically air pollution. UAVs can fill gaps currently present in modern Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) thanks to high maneuverability, fast deployment and hovering capability, commonly found in quadricopters. This survey will offer an overview about networks and swarm. to discuss drone integration in real-world air pollution monitoring systems.*
